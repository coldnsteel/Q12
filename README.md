💰 Q12 Institutional Accumulation AgentThe Q12 Agent is a specialized algorithmic signal generator designed to detect early institutional accumulation patterns in low-to-mid-cap stocks, typically in the Technology, AI, and Defense sectors. It focuses on the 12-week window preceding a company's next earnings announcement, which is a period often exploited by "smart money" to establish positions quietly.The agent uses a scoring model (0-100) based on five key behavioral, insider, and fundamental signals, plus an ML anomaly detection bonus.🎯 Scoring & SignalsThe model identifies stocks where large-scale buying is occurring with minimal price impact (the "drip-feed" pattern).SignalMax Score (Base)LogicAccumulation (Core)40High Volume (>1.1x 20-day SMA) combined with Low Volatility (<0.5x ATR). Time-decayed multiplier applied closer to earnings.Short Interest Drop (SIR)20Significant reduction (>= 15%) in Days To Cover (DTC) combined with flat price action. Time-decayed multiplier applied closer to earnings.Insider Buys (Form 4)15Net open-market purchases by corporate insiders in the 12-week window.Institutional 13F Change15Increase in total institutional holdings in the most recent 13F filing vs. the prior quarter.News Proxy10Detection of positive, relevant news (e.g., large AI contracts, government deals, sensor infrastructure) combined with positive VADER sentiment.ML Anomaly Bonus+10Isolation Forest flag indicating abnormal trading behavior (outlier in volume, range, or OBV slope) in the last 5 days.🛠️ Project Structureq12_agent.py: The core Python script containing the universe builder, signal logic, scoring engine, and main execution loop.index.html: The HTML frontend used to display the final report visually (as seen on the harmonic.fun initiative).requirements.txt (Needs to be created): Lists all necessary Python dependencies.⚙️ Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesYou need API keys for the following services:ServicePurposeVariable in q12_agent.pyPolygon.ioCore market data (Aggregates, Tickers, Snapshots)POLYGON_KEYSEC APIInstitutional 13F Filings & Insider Form 4 dataSEC_KEYFinnhubPrimary Earnings Calendar & News DataFINNHUB_KEYAlpha VantageEarnings Calendar FallbackALPHA_KEYPython DependenciesBefore running, ensure you have all required Python packages installed.

Configuration:Open q12_agent.py and replace the placeholder API keys in the --- CONFIGURATION --- section with your actual keys.# --- CONFIGURATION (MUST BE REPLACED WITH ACTUAL KEYS) ---

🚀 How to Run the AgentExecute the script:python q12_agent.py
Review Output:The console will print a detailed "Q12 Agent Scan Report" showing classified tickers and their scores.Graphical volume charts for flagged tickers will be saved to the ./q12_reports/ directory (e.g., NVTS_volume.png).View Report:The data generated by the script can be fed into the index.html viewer for a graphical presentation of the weekly report.Created on Dec 2, 2025.
